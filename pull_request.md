# Algorithms

Each directory contains a separate problem that you'll be tasked with solving. Inside each directory, you'll find instructions for that problem, along with a test file as well as an empty skeleton file. 

There isn't an official prescribed order for tackling the problems, though a subjective ranking of the given problems from easiest to hardest might go something like this:

- [ ] `stock_prices`
- [ ] `recipe_batches`
- [ ] `eating_cookies`
- [ ] `rock_paper_scissors`
- [ ] `making_change`
- [ ] [Stretch Problem] `knapsack`
